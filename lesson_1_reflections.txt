1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	because is not imposible that the new code may have some bugs, also, by mistake we can easly
	introduce one letter, or any other case, the important thing is that viewing the two versions
	of the same file can help us to find the diferences between them and find the bug easly.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    This way if we made a big change in a program we allways have backups, can find bugs, etc.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The advantage of do it manually is that we know better than anyone else when to create a commit, but
	may we can forget crate them, that is the advantage of having automatic versions.

4. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	May Git do it because in a lot of proyects there are alot of files that are modified to create
	the whole proyect.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	With git log i can see the history of commits that i made, and with git diff i can see the changes
	i made between two commits

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because i have the guarante and the safety that it doesnÂ´t matter what happen to the code proyect,
	i always have a backup to start again.

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my college proyects
