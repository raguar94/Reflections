When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i'm working in an important proyect, and i need to work in different places, i will be easier having
  a remote repository than going everywhere with a laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

	Because that all the information i have in my computer won´t be in the remote repository, only the 
	informatión i think is relevant or it's necesary for an easy access will be in the remote repository.
