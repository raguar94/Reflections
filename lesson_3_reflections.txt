When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When i'm working in an important proyect, and i need to work in different places, i will be easier having
  a remote repository than going everywhere with a laptop.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with 
your remote repository?

	Because that all the information i have in my computer won´t be in the remote repository, only the 
	informatión i think is relevant or it's necesary for an easy access will be in the remote repository.
	
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	The difference between a branche and fork & clone, is that a branche is a path that let us change
	differents aspects in a code without interfere with anotherone, finaly fork and clone have the same 
	function, the difference is that fork is used to copy repositorys in GitHub, and clone to copy
	repositorys to our devices.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	The reasons are two, first, to know wich are the differences between my code and the remote one, 
	and the second reason is to know if the remote one was modified.
